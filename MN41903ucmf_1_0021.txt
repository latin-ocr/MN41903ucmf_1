The only ms* oi the fragment of a Latin translation of the
Assumptio Mosis is the Ambrosian palimpsest C 73 inf, s. VII. As
sar as it was possible, injured as it is by reagents, Ι compared it once

rnore at Easter 1904. Ι give the text as it is in the ms.; ³only instead

of abbreviations 1 print the words in full, adding a modern punctuation
and the usuoi division into chapters and verses. characters, which
could not be read with certainty, are printed in italics; the probable
number oi the characters which have been in the gaps, is given by an
equai number of points. At the bottom of the page I give my own
-conjectures and those oi others, explanations of iate Latin forms aud
exegetica] notes, and at the end the testimonia which certainly refer to
the Assumptio Mosis.
